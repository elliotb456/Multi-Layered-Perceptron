# Multi-Layered-Perceptron
An MLP machine designed to work with the Iris dataset to categorize the iris flowers into one of three species based on their four features.

The Iris dataset comprises 150 instances of iris flowers each possessing four attributes and a class label that specifies the species of the iris. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher, a statistician and biologist in his paper titled "The Use of Measurements, in Taxonomic Problems" published in 1936. This dataset serves as a known resource for examples in machine learning and statistics. (Fisher 1988)
The Iris dataset represents a classification problem where the objective is to categorize the iris flowers into one of three species based on their four features. Although this dataset behaves well achieving 100% accuracy with algorithms can still be challenging. It is not particularly suitable for datasets or large-scale problems. Despite its size, it provides a platform for exploring data visualization techniques, clustering methods and classification algorithms. (Fisher 1988)
